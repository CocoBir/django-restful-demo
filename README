    Django Restful Demo
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    ~ what's it for?
    Django `restframework` is very hard to start even
    with rich docs, I try to read the documents three
    times, after that I just head for the source code
    of it. This demo use the higher API of the framework
    to make it DRY.

    ~ what's this project?
    This demo based on another project and I just use
    the restful design style, see more about the project
    here:

    ~ what's making it special?
    1. use router and viewset
    2. customer response message and code number
    3. an reusable serializer
    4. support split page
    5. serializer tricky
    6. Good design can be used as template
